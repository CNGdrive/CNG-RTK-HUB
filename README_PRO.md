# CNG RTK Hub Pro - Professional RTK Equipment Interface

## üéØ **Professional RTK Client for External Hardware**

### **Target Users:**
- Professional land surveyors
- Construction engineers  
- Precision agriculture specialists
- Anyone with external dual-frequency RTK equipment

### **System Requirements:**
- **External Hardware:** Dual-frequency GNSS receivers (L1/L2 bands)
- **Backend Service:** Python RTK service running on network-accessible device
- **Network:** Local network connection between device and RTK backend
- **Accuracy:** Centimeter-level positioning capability

Professional RTK Workflow:
External GNSS Hardware ‚Üí Python RTK Backend ‚Üí Flutter Client
                      ‚Üì
                   Network Connection
                   (WebSocket + HTTP)
                      ‚Üì
              Real-time Position Display
```

### **Connection Requirements:**
- **WebSocket**: Real-time position streaming (port 8765)
- **HTTP API**: Configuration and status (port 8080)
- **Python Backend**: Must be running and accessible

---

## üì± **Current Application State**

### **‚úÖ Implemented Components:**
- Flutter project structure with modular architecture
- WebSocket service for real-time data streaming
- HTTP API service for backend communication
- Provider-based state management
- Field-optimized UI components:
  - Dashboard screen with position display
  - Accuracy indicator with RTK status
  - Connection status monitoring
  - Position card with coordinate display

### **üîß What Works:**
- App builds successfully (Android APK)
- UI displays properly with professional design
- WebSocket/HTTP client services implemented
- State management functional

### **‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Development:**
- **Backend Integration**: Currently connects to localhost - needs proper backend
- **Real Data Flow**: Currently shows mock/empty states
- **Professional Features**: Settings, calibration, logging
- **Field Operations**: Data export, session management
- **Error Handling**: Robust connection recovery

---

## üöÄ **Development Priorities**

### **Phase 1: Backend Integration**
1. Ensure Python RTK backend is functional
2. Test WebSocket/HTTP connectivity
3. Implement real data parsing and display
4. Add connection management and recovery

### **Phase 2: Professional Features**
1. RTK session management
2. Position logging and export
3. Accuracy monitoring and alerts
4. Equipment configuration interface

### **Phase 3: Field Optimization**
1. Battery optimization for long surveys
2. Offline capability and data caching
3. Professional reporting features
4. Multi-device synchronization

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Stack**

### **Current Dependencies:**
```yaml
flutter: 3.8.1+
provider: ^6.1.1          # State management
http: ^1.1.0              # Backend API calls
web_socket_channel: ^2.4.0 # Real-time data
flutter_map: ^6.1.0       # Future mapping features
permission_handler: ^11.0.1 # System permissions
device_info_plus: ^10.1.0  # Device information
```

### **Architecture Pattern:**
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel with Provider
- **Service Layer**: Separate services for WebSocket/HTTP
- **Modular Design**: Byte-sized files for maintainability
