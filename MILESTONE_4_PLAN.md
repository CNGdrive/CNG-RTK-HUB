# ðŸ“± MILESTONE 4: FLUTTER FRONTEND INTEGRATION

## Overview
Develop Flutter mobile frontend for RTK client with WebSocket real-time data streaming and HTTP API control integration.

## Objectives
- **Primary**: Create production-ready Flutter app for Android ruggedized tablets
- **Backend Integration**: Connect to existing RTK service (localhost:8765 WebSocket, localhost:8080 HTTP)
- **User Experience**: Field-ready interface for RTK positioning operations
- **Platform**: Android-first with 8+ hour field operation capability

## Technical Foundation

### Backend Services (READY âœ…)
- **RTK Service**: `python -m src.rtk_service`
- **WebSocket API**: ws://localhost:8765 (real-time GNSS data)
- **HTTP REST API**: http://localhost:8080 (control operations)
- **NTRIP Integration**: Multi-mount correction support

### Flutter App Requirements
- **Platform**: Android (API 21+, ruggedized tablet optimized)
- **Architecture**: Provider state management, modular design
- **Connectivity**: WebSocket client + HTTP client
- **UI/UX**: Field-ready interface (large touch targets, high contrast)
- **Performance**: <100MB memory, <30% CPU, responsive UI

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Flutter Project Setup
- [ ] Create Flutter project structure
- [ ] Add dependencies (http, web_socket_channel, provider)
- [ ] Configure Android build settings
- [ ] Set up development environment

### Phase 2: Backend Connectivity
- [ ] WebSocket client implementation
- [ ] HTTP API client implementation  
- [ ] Connection state management
- [ ] Error handling and reconnection logic

### Phase 3: Core UI Components
- [ ] GNSS data display widgets
- [ ] RTK status indicators
- [ ] NTRIP management interface
- [ ] Settings and configuration screens

### Phase 4: Real-time Data Integration
- [ ] Live position display
- [ ] RTK correction status
- [ ] Satellite information
- [ ] Navigation accuracy metrics

### Phase 5: Production Polish
- [ ] Field testing optimization
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] Battery usage optimization
- [ ] Error recovery testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] App connects to RTK service successfully
- [ ] Real-time GNSS data display working
- [ ] RTK corrections management functional
- [ ] Field-ready user interface
- [ ] <1000ms UI response time
- [ ] Stable 8+ hour operation

## Notes
- Backend is production-ready and tested
- Focus on Flutter implementation and integration
- Maintain consistency with backend API design
- Prioritize field usability over complex features
