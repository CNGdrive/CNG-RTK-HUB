## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Requirements**

### **New Dependencies to Add:**
```yaml
# Add to pubspec.yaml:
geolocator: ^10.1.0         # Native GPS access
location: ^5.0.3            # Android location services
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2  # Settings persistence
# dart:io (built-in) for TCP sockets
# dart:typed_data (built-in) for binary parsing
```

### **Android Permissions Required:**
```xml
<!-- Add to AndroidManifest.xml: -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

### **Key Technical Challenges:**
1. **RTCM Parsing**: Binary protocol with 200+ message types
2. **Coordinate Transformations**: Precise mathematical corrections
3. **Real-time Processing**: GPS + NTRIP data synchronization
4. **Android Integration**: Native location services

## 📋 **Current State Assessment**

### **✅ What Exists (Base from Pro Version):**
- Flutter project structure
- Provider state management framework
- Basic UI components (dashboard, widgets)
- WebSocket/HTTP services (not needed for this version)

### **🚧 What Needs Complete Implementation:**
**Everything related to standalone smartphone functionality!**

The current app is just a UI shell - you need to build:
- All native GPS integration
- All NTRIP client functionality
- All RTCM parsing capability
- All correction algorithms
- All enhanced UI components

---

## 🎯 **Development Priorities**

### **Priority 1: Core Functionality**
- Get native GPS working first
- Establish NTRIP connection second
- Parse basic RTCM messages third
- Apply simple corrections fourth

### **Priority 2: User Experience**
- CORS station selection interface
- Real-time accuracy improvement display
- Connection status and health monitoring
- Settings and configuration management

### **Priority 3: Optimization**
- Battery usage optimization
- Performance tuning for real-time processing
- Error recovery and reconnection logic
- Field testing and validation

---

## 🌐 **NTRIP/CORS Understanding**

### **NTRIP Protocol Basics:**
- **TCP Connection**: Standard socket to CORS station
- **Authentication**: HTTP-style credentials
- **Data Stream**: Binary RTCM 3.x messages
- **Real-time**: Continuous correction flow

### **CORS Station Examples:**
```
Free Example:
- Host: rtgpsout.unavco.org
- Port: 2101
- Mount: /P041_RTCM3

Commercial Example:
- Host: [provider].ntrip.com
- Port: 2101
- Mount: /[station]_RTCM3
```

## 🚫 **What NOT to Focus On**

### **Avoid These Approaches:**
- ❌ **Python Backend Integration**: This is for the PRO version
- ❌ **WebSocket Services**: Direct NTRIP connection instead
- ❌ **External Hardware**: Focus on smartphone GPS only
- ❌ **Centimeter Accuracy**: Aim for sub-meter improvement

### **Stay Consumer-Focused:**
- 🎯 **Smartphone First**: Always use phone's built-in GPS
- 🎯 **Internet Connection**: NTRIP over WiFi/cellular
- 🎯 **Realistic Expectations**: 0.5-2m accuracy improvement
- 🎯 **Easy Setup**: Consumer-friendly interface
