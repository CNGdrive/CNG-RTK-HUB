# Technical Risks & Mitigation Strategy

## High-Risk Items

### 1. Android USB Host Compatibility
**Risk**: Not all Android devices support USB host mode for direct receiver connection  
**Impact**: Core functionality failure on unsupported devices  
**Mitigation**: Device compatibility database, Bluetooth fallback, USB host detection on startup

### 2. Real-time Performance on Mobile (UPDATED)
**Risk**: <1000ms latency target (relaxed from <300ms) may still be challenging with dual-receiver processing  
**Impact**: Poor user experience, inaccurate timing metrics for dual-receiver benchmarking  
**Mitigation**: Performance profiling during development, adaptive quality settings, background processing optimization, receiver prioritization

### 3. Battery Optimization vs Real-time Processing
**Risk**: Android power management may throttle app during 8+ hour operation  
**Impact**: Data loss, connection drops, reduced accuracy  
**Mitigation**: Battery optimization whitelisting guidance, foreground service implementation, power usage monitoring

### 4. UBX + Unicore Binary Protocol Complexity
**Risk**: Dual-protocol parsing (UBX + Unicore binary) errors could cause data corruption or crashes  
**Impact**: Unreliable data, false accuracy readings, protocol conflicts  
**Mitigation**: Extensive unit testing with recorded frames, checksum/CRC validation, safe mode NMEA fallback, protocol isolation

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. NTRIP Connection Reliability
**Risk**: Cellular/WiFi instability in field environments  
**Impact**: Loss of RTK corrections, reduced accuracy  
**Mitigation**: Exponential backoff reconnection, multiple NTRIP source failover, connection quality indicators

### 6. Flutter-Python Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Cross-platform communication between Flutter UI and Python backend  
**Impact**: Development complexity, potential performance bottlenecks  
**Mitigation**: Well-defined API contracts, comprehensive integration testing, native Android alternative

### 7. Storage Management on Mobile
**Risk**: Limited storage on Android devices for continuous logging  
**Impact**: Data loss, app crashes  
**Mitigation**: Automatic log rotation, storage monitoring and cleanup, cloud sync priority queuing

## Low-Risk Items

### 8. Dual-Receiver Resource Usage
**Risk**: Connecting ZED-F9P + UM980 simultaneously may overwhelm Android device resources  
**Impact**: Performance degradation, battery drain, memory pressure  
**Mitigation**: Android resource monitoring, connection limits based on hardware, resource usage monitoring, graceful degradation

### 9. Windows Integration Complexity
**Risk**: File export/import workflows may be cumbersome  
**Impact**: Poor workflow integration  
**Mitigation**: Standard file formats (CSV, RINEX), cloud storage integration, future native Windows app

### 10. Settings Profile Complexity
**Risk**: Complex configuration management may confuse users  
**Impact**: Misconfiguration, data quality issues  
**Mitigation**: Wizard-based setup, profile validation, default configurations for common scenarios

## Validation Strategy

### Pre-Implementation Risk Mitigation
Android device compatibility survey, performance benchmarking on target hardware, UBX protocol proof-of-concept, NTRIP reliability testing

### Implementation Phase Monitoring
Continuous performance profiling, battery usage analysis, memory leak detection, connection stability metrics

### Field Validation Requirements
8+ hour continuous operation tests, multi-device simultaneous operation, poor connectivity scenario testing, resource exhaustion recovery testing
