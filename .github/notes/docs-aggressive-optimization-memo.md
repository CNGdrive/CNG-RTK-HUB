# Aggressive Documentation Optimization Memo

**Purpose**: Achieve 1,200+ character reduction while maintaining implementation-readiness

**Risk Assessment**: 
- Low: API inlining, verbosity reduction
- Medium: File merging, ADR restructuring
- High: None identified

**Checkpoint Commits**:
1. `feat: inline flutter-python-api → tech-spec (note#1)`
2. `refactor: compress implementation-checklist verbosity (note#2)` 
3. `restructure: ADRs to compact table format (note#3)`
4. `merge: modular-architecture → implementation-checklist (note#4)`
5. `cleanup: remove tech-spec redundancies (note#5)`
6. `validate: optimization targets achieved (note#6)`

**Rollback Steps**:
1. `git checkout main` (return to original state)
2. `git branch -D docs/aggressive-optimization` (delete branch)
3. Alternative: `git revert <commit-hash>` for selective rollback

**Expected Test Commands**:
- Character count validation: `Get-ChildItem "*.md" | ForEach { (Get-Content $_.Name | Measure-Object -Character).Characters } | Measure-Object -Sum`
- File count verification: `Get-ChildItem "*.md" | Measure-Object | Select Count`
- Reference integrity: `grep -r "deleted-file.md" .`

**Success Criteria**:
- Total character reduction: ≥1,200 characters
- File count reduction: 9 → 7 files  
- All references maintained and functional
- Implementation-readiness preserved

**Checkpoint Status**:
- [ ] Checkpoint 1: flutter-python-api inlined
- [ ] Checkpoint 2: implementation-checklist compressed  
- [ ] Checkpoint 3: ADRs restructured
- [ ] Checkpoint 4: modular-architecture merged
- [ ] Checkpoint 5: tech-spec cleaned
- [ ] Checkpoint 6: validation complete

**Smoke-test Results**:
- Initial file count: 9 files
- Target file count: 7 files
- Character reduction achieved: TBD
