**File Reduction**: 9 → 8 files (2 eliminated, keeping this summary)  

### OPTIMIZATIONS DEPLOYED ✅
1. **flutter-python-api.md** → DELETED (content inlined into tech-spec.md)
2. **modular-architecture.md** → DELETED (patterns merged into implementation-checklist.md)  
3. **architecture-decisions.md** → COMPRESSED (136 lines → 10 lines, table format)
4. **implementation-checklist.md** → ENHANCED (Architecture Overview added, verbose prompts removed)
5. **tech-spec.md** → OPTIMIZED (Flutter-Python API section added, redundant sections removed)
