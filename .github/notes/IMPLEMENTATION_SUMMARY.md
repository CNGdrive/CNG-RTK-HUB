# Implementation Plan Summary - August 24, 2025

## âœ… Completed: Dual-Driver Architecture Specification

Successfully created comprehensive architecture and implementation plan for CNG-RTK-HUB dual-receiver system.

### ðŸŽ¯ **New Documentation Created**

1. **`dual-driver-architecture.md`** - Complete system architecture
   - Plugin-based driver system for ZED-F9P + UM980
   - Unified data normalization layer
   - Android resource management strategy
   - File structure and data flow specifications

2. **`protocol-normalization-spec.md`** - Protocol mapping details  
   - UBX (ZED-F9P) â†’ GNSSState mapping
   - Unicore binary (UM980) â†’ GNSSState mapping
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Cross-protocol validation requirements

3. **`android-resource-management.md`** - Mobile optimization strategy
   - Memory management (80MB limit)
   - CPU allocation (30% target)
   - Battery optimization (8+ hour operation)
   - Connection resource management

4. **`feat-20250824-dual-driver-memo.md`** - Implementation plan
   - 6-checkpoint implementation roadmap
   - Rollback procedures for each checkpoint
   - Testing strategy with smoke tests
   - Success criteria and validation steps

### ðŸ”„ **Updated Existing Documentation**

- **`implementation-checklist.md`** - Added UM980 driver milestone and dual-receiver support
- **`tech-spec.md`** - Updated for dual-receiver architecture and relaxed latency targets  
- **`architecture-decisions.md`** - Added ADR-009 for dual-driver architecture decision
- **`technical-risks.md`** - Added dual-protocol complexity and resource usage risks

### ðŸ“Š **Key Architecture Decisions**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Dual Receivers** | ZED-F9P + UM980 | Field benchmarking and redundancy |
| **Protocol Support** | UBX + Unicore Binary | Native high-performance parsing |
| **Performance Target** | <1000ms latency | Accuracy prioritized over speed |
| **Resource Limits** | 80MB memory, 30% CPU | Android tablet optimization |
| **Architecture Pattern** | Plugin-based drivers | Extensible to future receivers |

### ðŸš€ **Ready for Implementation**

The **Refactor - Implement** agent now has:
- âœ… Complete architecture specification
- âœ… 6-checkpoint implementation plan with clear commit messages
- âœ… Protocol normalization mappings (UBX â†” Unicore)
- âœ… Android resource optimization strategy
- âœ… Testing strategy with recorded binary samples
- âœ… Rollback procedures for each development phase

### ðŸ“ˆ **Implementation Complexity**
**Estimated**: 13-19 days (Medium-High complexity)
- **Reduced by**: Relaxed latency requirements, Android-first focus
- **Increased by**: Dual-protocol parsing complexity

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Phase**
Branch: `feat/20250824-dual-driver-architecture`
Ready for **Refactor - Implement** agent execution.
